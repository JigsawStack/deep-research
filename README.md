# Deep Research

Deep Research is an open source library for conducting deep, multi-hop research with reasoning capabilities. It performs focused web searches with recursive exploration to provide comprehensive, evidence-backed answers to complex questions.

[Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-deep-research) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/)'s Deep Research is gatekeeped and close sourced, So we decided to built the opposite‚Äîan open, fully customizable deep research framework.

## üß± Core Concepts

| Concept           | Description                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deep Thinking** | The system breaks down a question into logical parts, reasons through them independently, and synthesizes an answer. |
| **Deep Research** | The system performs multi-hop, focused web searches, compares the findings, and composes an evidence-backed answer.  |

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
npm i deep-research
# or
yarn add deep-research
# or
bun i deep-research
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { createDeepResearch } from "deep-research";

// Create instance using the factory function with default settings
const deepResearch = createDeepResearch({
  OPENAI_API_KEY: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  GEMINI_API_KEY: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY,
  DEEPINFRA_API_KEY: process.env.DEEPINFRA_API_KEY,
  JIGSAW_API_KEY: process.env.JIGSAW_API_KEY,
});

// Research prompt
const prompt = "What are the recent developments in quantum computing?";

// Generate research report
const result = await deepResearch.generate(prompt);

console.log(result.data.text);
console.log(result.data.bibliography);
```

### Advanced Usage

```typescript
import { createDeepResearch } from "deep-research";
import { createGoogleGenerativeAI } from "@ai-sdk/google";
import { createDeepInfra } from "@ai-sdk/deepinfra";
import { createOpenAI } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Initialize AI providers
const gemini = createGoogleGenerativeAI({
  apiKey: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY,
});

const deepinfra = createDeepInfra({
  apiKey: process.env.DEEPINFRA_API_KEY,
});

const openaiProvider = createOpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

// Get model instances
const geminiModel = gemini("gemini-2.0-flash");
const deepseekModel = deepinfra("deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1");
const openaiModel = openaiProvider("gpt-4o");

// Create instance with custom configuration
const deepResearch = createDeepResearch({
  max_output_tokens: 30000, // Hard upper limit of tokens
  target_output_tokens: 10000, // Target report length
  max_depth: 4, // specify how many iterations of research to perform
  max_breadth: 3, // specify how many subqueries to generate
  models: {
    default: openaiModel, // Custom models from AI SDK
    reasoning: deepseekModel,
    output: geminiModel,
  },
  logging: {
    enabled: true, // Enable console logging
  },
});

// Research prompt
const prompt = "What are the recent developments in quantum computing?";

// Generate research report
const result = await deepResearch.generate(prompt);

console.log(result.data.text);
console.log(result.data.bibliography);
```

## Configuration Options for Deep Research

| Category | Option | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| **max_depth** | - | Number | 3 | Controls how many iterations of research the system will perform. Higher values allow for more thorough, multi-hop research. The system will continue researching until it has a complete answer or reaches this limit. |
| **max_breadth** | - | Number | 3 | Controls how many subqueries are generated for each research iteration. Higher values enable wider exploration of the topic. Determines how many parallel search paths are pursued. |
| **max_output_tokens** | - | Number | 32000 | Hard upper limit on the length of the final report. Must be greater than target_output_tokens. |
| **target_output_tokens** | - | Number | optional | The ideal length for the generated report. The system will try to produce a report of approximately this length. |
| **models** | default | LanguageModelV1 | GPT-4o | The primary model used for most operations. |
| | reasoning | LanguageModelV1 | DeepSeek-R1 | Model used for reasoning about search results. |
| | output | LanguageModelV1 | GPT-4o | Model used for generating the final report. |
| **logging** | enabled | Boolean | false | When set to true, enables detailed console logging. Helpful for debugging and understanding the research process. |
| **API Keys** | JIGSAW_API_KEY | String | required | For accessing the JigsawStack API for web searches. |
| | OPENAI_API_KEY | String | optional if custom models provided | For OpenAI model access. |
| | DEEPINFRA_API_KEY | String | optional if custom models provided | For DeepInfra model access. |
